# Halstead Calculator
The purpose of designing this tool is to help in determining the complexity of source code based on the operands and operators. By determining the complexity of code, an appropriate amount of time and resources can be allocated for testing and further development. This Halstead Calculator tool can be used to analyze code during code development and beyond to aid maintenance and to track the complexity and growth of the project.
